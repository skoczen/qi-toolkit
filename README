This repo is a collection of tools and scripts used across QI projects.

It's pretty bare right now, but will see buildout as the joy of consolidation spreads.


Includes:
- fabbase.py - the base fabric setup for (mostly) webfaction deploys
- smoke_tests.py - a helper method for running quick django client tests.
- env_middleware.py - a simple middleware that adds ENV to the request context (from settings.ENV)
