This repo is a collection of tools and scripts used across QI projects.

It's pretty bare right now, but will see buildout as the joy of consolidation spreads.


Includes:
- fabbase.py - the base fabric setup for (mostly) webfaction deploys
- smoke_tests.py - a helper method for running quick django client tests.
- context_processors.py - a simple context processor that adds ENV to the request context (from settings.ENV)
- helpers.py - helpers for rendering views
- robots.py - basic robots.txt handling
- factory.py - a base factory class for common data generation.
